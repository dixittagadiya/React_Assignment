=> What are Keys in React?
In React, keys are special attributes that help identify elements in a list. Keys are essential for React to efficiently manage and update the DOM when rendering lists of components.

=> Why are Keys Important?
1. Tracking Element Identity:

- React uses keys to determine which items in a list have changed, been added, or been removed.
- This allows React to optimize rendering by reordering or updating only the necessary elements, rather than re-rendering the entire list.

2. Improved Performance:

- Using unique keys ensures React can efficiently "diff" the virtual DOM and apply minimal changes to the actual DOM.

=> What Happens if You Do Not Provide a Unique Key?
1. React's Default Behavior:

- If you donâ€™t provide keys, React will fall back to using the array index as the default key.
- For example:
const items = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item}</li>);

2. Problems with Using Index or Non-Unique Keys:

- React may fail to correctly identify which items have been added, removed, or changed.
- This can lead to:
   - Incorrect Component State: Stateful components may retain incorrect state after reordering.
   - Unnecessary Re-Renders: React may re-render or update more elements than necessary, reducing performance.
   - UI Bugs: Animations or dynamic updates might behave unexpectedly.
