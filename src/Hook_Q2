=> Problems Solved by Hooks
1. Complex Component Logic:

 - Before Hooks: Components with complex logic had to be split across multiple lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount. This made it hard to organize related logic, especially if the logic involved multiple states or side effects.
 - With Hooks: Hooks like useEffect allow you to group related logic together, making components easier to read, maintain, and test.

2. Code Reusability:

 - Before Hooks: React class components lacked an efficient way to share stateful logic. Developers had to rely on patterns like higher-order components (HOCs) or render props, which often led to nested and hard-to-read component trees.
 - With Hooks: Custom hooks enable developers to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic in a clean and composable way without affecting the component hierarchy.

3. State Management in Function Components:

 - Before Hooks: Functional components were stateless, and adding state or lifecycle features required converting them to class components. This discouraged developers from using simpler functional components.
 - With Hooks: useState and useReducer introduced state management directly into functional components, allowing developers to build complex features while retaining the simplicity of functional components.

4. Handling Side Effects:

 - Before Hooks: Side effects in class components were managed using lifecycle methods, which often became cluttered and difficult to track.
 - With Hooks: useEffect provides a unified way to handle side effects, making it easier to manage logic for things like data fetching, subscriptions, and DOM updates.

5. Verbose and Boilerplate Code in Class Components:

 - Before Hooks: Writing class components required more boilerplate code, including constructors, this bindings, and lifecycle methods.
 - With Hooks: Functional components with hooks are more concise, removing the need for unnecessary boilerplate.

6. Improved Developer Experience:

 - Before Hooks: Debugging class components often required understanding this context, lifecycle intricacies, and complex component hierarchies.
 - With Hooks: Hooks provide a cleaner mental model, with a focus on state, side effects, and composability, simplifying the debugging process.

=> Why Hooks Are an Important Addition
1. Simplicity and Readability: Hooks simplify React development by allowing developers to manage state and side effects more intuitively. This improves the readability of components, especially those with complex logic.

2. Functional Paradigm Shift: Hooks promote functional programming principles, making React components more declarative and emphasizing immutability and composability.

3. Code Reusability and Composition: Custom hooks make it easy to extract and reuse logic across multiple components, fostering better organization and modularity.

4. Backward Compatibility: Hooks were designed to work alongside existing class components, allowing developers to adopt them incrementally without rewriting entire codebases.

5. Encourages Best Practices: Hooks naturally encourage developers to split components into smaller, more manageable pieces. They also make it easier to follow React's best practices, like avoiding unnecessary re-renders and properly handling dependencies.

6. Community and Ecosystem Impact: Since their introduction in React 16.8, hooks have become a standard in the React ecosystem. They have inspired a wave of new libraries and patterns, aligning with modern JavaScript practices and enhancing the developer experience.
